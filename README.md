# Assignment Template

This repository contains the base files for the assignment. You will need to create a _private duplicate_ in your module organisation. Carry out the following steps, taken from the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/user/articles/duplicating-a-repository):

Temporarily clone this repository to your development computer:

`git clone https://github.coventry.ac.uk/web/template-dynamic-websites.git`

Create a new **private** repository in the module organisation on the GitHub server and copy the _clone url_ to the clipboard (the one that begins with `https://` and ends in `.git`.

Mirror Push to this new repository, replacing xxx with the url from the clipboard:

`git push --mirror xxx`

Once you are sure the code is in your new repository, delete the temporary local repository.
